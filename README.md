# Elysium

## Preface
Elysium is a fork of the Phoenix Flavour that expands this already fantastic guide with over a hundred new additions and optional Creation Club support. Many new additions, such as Vokrii, Apocalypse, Nemesis, LotD, 3DNPC, and a wide variety of new content. You should expect a more challenging game with this list. 

As for stability and conflict resolution, Elysium is base off of TPF and have been Patched for the new additions to ensure consistency and compatibility across the board. In the case where patches didn't already exist or were inadequate, they have been created.
